Howdy! You probably know me on Twitter as "12th man stan account"
(<a href= "https://twitter.com/12th_man_stan">@12th_man_stan</a>).
Welcome to the home page for my fun little side project, College Football Sentiment Analysis (CFBSA).
My hope is that this CFB-centric project will achieve accurate sentiment analysis
of the various college football fanbases on Twitter. 
</p>

<p>
To scrape the datasets for analysis, I'm familiarizing myself with the Twitter
API in Python. The plan is to use machine learning concepts to implement sentiment
analysis on these datasets. Why do all of this? Right now, my priority is learning
for learning's sake. But I have a few ideas for future applications of this project
that I'm not ready to share quite yet.
</p>

<p>
I'm learning as I go along, so I may expand this page to include periodic updates.
If you want to keep up with my progress, I encourage you to follow me on Twitter.
The link is at the bottom of the page. Thank you for visiting!
